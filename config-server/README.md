# **Configuration Server** #

Configuration Server is a server which allow to keep application settings centralized.
The implementation is based on **Spring Cloud Config** server with the following features:

* Encrypted sensitive properties for applications using a shared key. The shared key
  **MUST** be provided as a command line parameter -**Dencrypt.key=** or as an environment variable **ENCRYPT_KEY**
* For a better security an asymmetrical encryption should be used based on private/public pair of keys. 
* It use a **Bitbucket** remote repository to store application properties.
* It support **WebHooks** notifications via the **/monitor** end point. The config server **MUST** be visible outside on the network
from **Bitbucket**. If is not possible for different reasons including security you ca use the **ngrok** tool
which allow you to create a secured tunnel between **Bitbucket** repository and the machine on which
**Config server** is running. 

Example: 
```
#!bash

$ ngrok http 8888
```


The Bitbucket webhook will call the **/monitor** endpoint on **ngrok** server which will forward the request
to specified port (**8888**) on the local machine. For more details please go to [https://ngrok.com](Link URL)

* Another feature is a **Service Bus** which is used to send refresh events to services registered with bus as listeners.
The **Service Bus** require a transport system, a message broker like RabbitMQ, Kafka or Redis. We are using RabbitMQ for our POC.
For refresh setting an **/bus/refresh** endpoint can be accessed via **POST** and a parameter **path=**
The **path** parameter support wildcards and specify which resources are targeted by the message.
Example: **path=servivce1** or **path=serv\*** or **path=\***

## **Important:** ##
In order to use the encryption and decryption features you need the full-strength JCE installed in your JVM (itâ€™s not there by default). You can download the "Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files" from Oracle, and follow instructions for installation (essentially replace the 2 policy files in the JRE lib/security directory with the ones that you downloaded).
